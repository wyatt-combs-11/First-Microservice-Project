# First-Microservice-Project
I personally recommend checking out the microservices project. It contacts my [Config Server Repo](https://github.com/wyatt-combs-11/config-server-repo) for real time updates for project configuration. More information to come when I decide how I want to organize features, usage, yada yada.
These projects also come from tutorials followed [here](https://www.javaguides.net/)
